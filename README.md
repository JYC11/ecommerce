# Ecommerce project

I'm currently working in a ecommerce company so I thought it would be fitting to make an ecommerce website.

Tbh, I have trouble visualizing/planning the entire project from scratch since I'm still quite a beginner so I'm following a course but I plan to make extensive changes to the project as I follow the course.

Some stuff I have in mind for now:
* adding tests for backend and frontend
* consistent formatting with black
* adding CI/CD
* redoing the architecture of the backend(doing it as I write the backend)
* rewriting the frontend in typescript(this is low on priority)
* Docker and Docker Compose
