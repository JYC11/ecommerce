# Backend

Did some pre-emptive re-organization of files in anticipation for Dockerizing the application.

Confusing folder names I know(server=>backend=>backend) I kinda messed up.

## Apps

### core

Contains the models to be used for the backend.

### order

Handles the order logic for the ecommerce website

### product

Handles the product logic for the ecommerce website

### user

Handles the user logic for the ecommerce website
